    <p class="para">I am learning to create and style webpages using html and css with AltCampus. I have learned how to use
      the command line interface to create, read, update and delete a directory using the commands. I learned about
    the most powerful version control system around called Git. Git along with Github (which is the Internet hosting
    service for software development and version control) makes collaboration to work on a single project with
    multiples people making changes in the project easy.</p>
